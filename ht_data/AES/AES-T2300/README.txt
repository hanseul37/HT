1. aes_128.v
----------------------
The Trojan is triggered whenever two predefined rare signals (s2[89] and s5[121] of the aes_128 module) in the AES-128 block cipher are simultaneously high. Upon activation, the Trojan attacks encryption by flipping the least significant bit of the existing encrypted output.

2. test_aes_128.v
----------------------
This file is the main test bench. It is self-checked. It feeds input data to the core and compares the correct result with the output of the core. If the output is wrong, the test bench will display an error message.

3. How to run
----------------------
Here are the commands to run this benchmark using VCS and IVERILOG:

VCS:
	vcs -c file_list.txt		// Compile to produce executable
	./simv						// Execute to generate VCD dump
	dve							// Signal visualization

------
IVERILOG:
	iverilog -c file_list.txt	// Compile to produce executable
	vvp a.out					// Execute to generate VCD dump
	gtkwave a.vcd				// Signal visualization
